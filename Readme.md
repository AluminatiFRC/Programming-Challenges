# Team 5495's Programming Challenges!
Welcome to FRC Team 5495's programming challenges! These are designed to help you get comfortable with using code. When working on these, you will need try different things to get it to work. You are encouraged to make challenges for yourself, or even work on other projects entirely. The more code you write, the better you will get.


This project is hosted on GitHub, a popular place for programmers to put their code online. GitHub uses a version control system called git. Git manages different versions of the code for the programmer, and works very well for teams of programmers.
