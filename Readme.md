# Team 5495's Programming Challenges
Welcome to FRC Team 5495's programming challenges! These are designed to help you get comfortable with using code. When working on these, you will need try different things to get it to work. You are encouraged to make challenges for yourself, or even work on other projects entirely. The more code you write, the better you will get.

This project will be updated with more challenges as time goes on.

This project is hosted on GitHub, a popular place for programmers to put their code online. GitHub uses a version control system called git. Git manages different versions of the code for the programmer, and works very well for teams of programmers. 

##Downloading
1. Click on the "Download Zip" button on the right side of the page. It's right below the colored bar.

3. Under the general category, select "Existing Projects into Workspace". 
4. Click on "Select Archive File" and then click "Browse" and navigate to the zip folder you just downloaded. It's probably called something like "Programming-Challenges-master.zip". Chances are that it's in your downloads folder. 
5. Make sure the "ProgrammingChallenges" project is selected and click "Finish". 

Again, if you have any questions, feel free to send me an email.

##The Challenges
These challenges are designed to help you get to know how to work with code in Java better. If you have any problems, feel free to email me at the address given on canvas.
Each challenge has a set of tests at the top and something for you to code down below. When you first run the project those tests are expected to fail. Your job to go to the sections that need to be written and implement them in a way that makes all of the tests pass. If you are not sure how to make all of the test pass, just try to get them working one at a time and move on to another problem if you get stuck. You can come back later or share you ideas with others and see if you can get unstuck.
Here are the challenges in a rough order of difficulty, but feel free to do them in any order you want.
* `MinMax`
* `AbsoluteValue`
* `LongestString`
* `Powers`
* `Fibonacci`
* `Palindrome`
* `AlphebeticalString`

###Running the Challenges
