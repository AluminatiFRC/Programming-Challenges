/**
 * This class is a template for creating new challenges. If you want to complete
 * challenges, look at some other classes, or read the readme.md. If you want to
 * make a new challenge, this is the right place! Just create a new class with the
 * name of your challenge, and copy and paste the guts of this template into it.
 * Challenges where you must print a certain output do not need to look at the
 * return value as done in test right now.
